* Backstory: Zeph was born under mysterious circumstances. Soon after being born, his mother disappeared, and his stepfather re-married. With his stepmom came two stepsisters, both much older and much meaner than him. He was not liked much, his parents did the bare minimum for him, and his sisters constantly bullied him. He didn't care about sports like the other boys his age. He liked to be in nature, observe the birds and listen to the sound of the wind. He often stayed in the nearby forest, which felt more like home than the house he grew up in. He didn't care about studies, it was really hard for him to concentrate and subjects bored the hell out of him For that he was constantly punished. He wanted to just run away from all his problems, but where shall he go? The answer came: a hellhound attack. Just as he was about to go home, he noticed something coming his way. It was a really big and really ugly dog. No leash, no owner. Something felt off. He didn't have time to ponder about the dog, as it was charging at him like a bullet. He quickly went into the house and shut the front door. The hellhound busted trough the door like it was made out of cardboard, with one goal "in mind": kill Zeph. His "loving family" was in the living room, mouths wide open at the sight of the dog. Zeph's stepmother yelled in terror, drawing the hellhound's attention to herself. With that smart move, Zeph had the chance to escape while the dog was busy snacking on his family. He ran as far as he could, for he knew if he stopped, that beast could smell him out from miles and find him. He hid in the forest he knew well, when a satyr came. The creature hastily hurried him to go to a certain place that would "keep those ugly things away from you". So with no idea why was that dog angry and why does that guy have goat legs, he went to that place. That place was Camp LAN.
