A special rule applied when the letter gamma was followed by another palatal 
(kappa, another gamma, khei, or even xei). When this occurred, the first gamma
was pronounced like "&ntilde;" in Spanish se&ntilde;or. The second consonant 
in this group was pronounced normally. Example: ἄγγελος (a&ntilde;gelos), 
means messenger.

Greek vowels can be divided into two types – short and long. Short and long
vowels were not pronounced differently. Rather, long vowels simply were
pronounced longer than short ones, and any pronunciation differences were
solely incidental to the time spent saying them. Some vowels had a short
letter and a long letter companion, but not all.

| Short  | Long  | Sound |
| --- | --- | --- |
| α | α  | "a" as in father |
| ε  | η  | "e" as in fed, "ey" as in hey! |
| ι  | ι  | "i" as in hit, "ee" as in feed |
| ο  | ω  | "o" as in ton, "o" as in tome |
| υ  | υ  | "u" sound like German "Müller" |
